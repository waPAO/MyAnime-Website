<h1 align="center">MyAnime</h1>

## Purpose

Anime has always been a big part of my life. Whether if it was watching it after school (or even during OOPS) or binging different shows during summer break, anime has always been a source of joy and entertainment to me.

Although, as my journey with anime grew larger and larger, my ability to keep up and remember everything I had watched steadily became a blur. Often times, I would try to recall certian shows, but would end up mixing them up as many plots can easily be confused with one another.

## Features 

* With **MyAnime**, you will be able to take care of this issue by adding in all the animes you have seen, are currently watching, and plan to watch. In the program, you will be able to rate and write summaries of each show, while also being able to predict the rating of shows you plan to watch. :white_check_mark:
